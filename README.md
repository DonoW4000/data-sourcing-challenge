# data-sourcing-challenge
Accessing data from the NYT and TMDB.
I first obtained the necessary API keys from each service.
Using these keys, I authenticated and fetched data from both APIs. 
After retrieving the data, I merged it based on common attributes, such as movie titles or release dates. 
I then cleaned the merged data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. 
Finally, I exported the cleaned dataset to a desired format, such as CSV, for further analysis
